<h3 align=left>The moment I never forgot</h3> 

<p align=left>I had a broken hand, when I was a kid my family always let us enjoy a horse thing, me and my siblings love riding horses. We were still a kid, so we rode it while there was someone who would guide it with a strap. 

<p>But one day, the guide is careless, and the horse tantrums and that is my turn to ride the horse. So I fell from that tantrum horse I broke my hand. At that time I was thin and I was 7 years old. I had a little bit of trauma with the horse after that, but now Iâ€™m okay and I will never ride it again.
