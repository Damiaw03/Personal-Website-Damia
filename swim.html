<p align=left>I have been swimming since I was a kid, this is because I stayed in the condo when I was kid, and that condo has a swimming pool, my brother loved to take me to the swimming pool every morning. 

<p align=left>When I was 7 years old, my mom sent me to swimming class with my little brother and sister. She wants us to know how to swim so we can't even feel how drowning like she feels. 

<p align=left>Since then, we all loved swimming, we all swim whenever we are, at the beach, in the River, and in any pool. We are all just really brave in any water sport because we never knew that water ghosts existed. 

<p align=left>But now, we are more careful, because we know if that thing can happen it will happen. 

<p align=left>Until now, if I had free time, I would spend it swimming at the pool.
