<h3 style="font-family:Arial" "font-size:14" align="left" >Hi, my name is Irdina Damia. I had so many nicknames in my life, at first they usually called me irdina but my family called me Dina I started to get a lot of nicknames when I started playing a game. Here are my other nicknames such as Soib, Meor, Mia, and the latest is Ib. But here in reality usually people call me Damia. If you want to know more, just read my website. As you know, I am currently in semester 2. I have been at university for almost a year and am still counting the days to finish my degree. I’m from University Teknologi Mara (UiTM) at Sungai Petani, Merbok, Kedah. I am taking the course Library Management. My code course is (KCDIM260 2B). At first, the university was a great place and I’m excited that I chose to continue my studies..but now I may be a little regretful but I’m going to finish it all because I need it. 
If you want to know more about why? I feel regret and still decided to finish my degree, you need to keep following and reading my website.<br></p> 

<p>This personal website is my assignment for subject introduction to HTML (IML 470). Before we start, I would like to thank Sir Mahadi who always supported me in this assignment until this assignment is finished. I also want to thank my family and my friends for the support in mental and physical in the process of finishing this assignment.<br></p>
